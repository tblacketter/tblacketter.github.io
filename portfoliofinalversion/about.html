            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>I have spent most of my 20s working as a construction laborer for several different companies. 
                After seeing what a lifetime of hard physical labor does to the body I decided to take a different path 
                and enter the technology sector. I am currently enrolled at the <i>College of Western Idaho</i> 
                in their <i>Software Development</i> program. I hope to use the skills I acquire from this program 
                to create a better future for myself. </p>
            <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
            <ul><li><u>Rugby</u> <br> For the past 7 years or so, 
                I have been apart of a few different Rugby clubs around the state of Idaho.
                 Rugby has been a big part of my life and has brought many positive experiences. 
                 Ive learned valuable lessons working with a team to achieve a common goal 
                 and have made many friends along the way.</p>
                </li>
                <li><u>Video Games</u> <br>
                Video games have been a good way Ive stayed in contact with my friends that live all over the country!
                I enjoy playing all different types and varieties but my favorites tend to invlove alot of logistics.
