HARPE GAMING HOME PAGE
======================

Welcome to Harpe Gaming. We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:

* Unplug
* Interact
* Reconnect

And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones 
that bring people together through shared experiences. With 
all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get
that from a computer screen. Sometimes you need the 
intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around 
a common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.

We are a local board and card game store located in the 
heart of Morgantown near the campus. We carry 
hundreds of games and puzzles, including educational games, family games, card games, historical 
simulations, role-playing games, and so much more. 
If you remember a great game from your youth, we 
probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.

We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate 
gaming and the company of good friends. 
Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down, pick out 
a game from our demo library and start playing. 
We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special 
social events. You'll always find a game to play.

We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We 
publish periodic reviews of new titles. Check out 
the review of Towers and Temples, 
new this month at Harpe Gaming.

Review of Towers and Temples

Game ID:	bg210
List Price:	$17.73
Media	Board: Game
Release Date:	October 21, 2017
Age:	10+
Players:	2 - 8
Time:	30 - 60 minutes


Rule an Ancient City
--------------------
Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer 
Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. 
Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient 
Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage 
the administration of a city. Each role provides 
a different ability and strategy. However, 
one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players 
must be constantly aware of betrayal 
and double-cross. This card game provides a ton 
of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players 
and expansion packs available for larger parties.

This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
carefully choose his or her roles and 
the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
of a card. However the level of randomness is 
just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not 
recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
and some of the game appeal.

Highly Recommended
------------------
Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is 
just about perfect and each player must 
carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the 
strategic possibilities are nearly endless, 
the game is simple to learn. The replay value is 
high and gets even better when you replace 
some of the cards with new cards available in the 
expansion packs.

Rating: 4.5 / 5

Great Strategic Board Game
------------------
We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 
to 6 players and we can strongly 
recommend the game. The different phases of the 
game are interesting and intriguing, from
bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. 
With the variety of cards and 
scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's 
a great introduction to the world of 
strategic board games and role playing.

An Incredible Game
------------------
The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent 
and one of the best around. As 
for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there 
are tough decisions to make every 
turn. It's not only important to select the character 
that increases your chances for scoring, 
but also to anticipate the characters the opponents 
are likely to select, and then hedge against 
their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability 
and deep strategic thinking. However, 
it can still be played at a more basic level for 
younger users.

We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as 
Best in its Class. Highly recommended.
